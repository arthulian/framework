2. **Sense-Making**

   Integrates varied data into a single cohesive perception of reality.

   **Examples**

   •    Constructs rationales that hold up against the test of time  
   •    Applies proven methods to structure the unknown

---

3. **Objectivity**

   Evaluates competing claims through bias-awareness, which regulates and uniformly applies empirical and rational standards.

   **Examples**

   •    Applies the “Veil of ignorance”  
   •    Summarizes emotions in one word to stay focused

---

4. **Self-Control**

   Regulates urges, attention, and conduct in response to immediate internal or external stimuli

   **Examples**

   •    Redirects attention or behavior when tempted, distracted, or emotionally reactive

---

5. **Fairness**

   Enforces impartial accountability, guided by perspective-taking and reciprocity, to prevent double standards

   **Examples**

   •    Shuns faultfinding and flattery  
   •    Admits mistakes to prevent hypocrisy and earn trust

---

6. **Perseverance**

   Maintains exertion and resolve amid hardship or challenge, led by reason not obstinacy.

   **Examples**

   •    Handles fear-response as a skill to refine  
   •    Confronts fear gradually and recurrently

---

7. **Self-Discipline**

   Consistent, adaptive regulation of behavior aligned with end-goals and principles, while avoiding rigidity and complacency.

   **Examples**

   •    Pursues minor progress even during difficult periods  
   •    Adjusts interim goals as needed to stay consistent with long-term goals

---

8. **Self-Efficacy**

   Confidence in one’s competence to meet challenges effectively, where each milestone strengthens belief in one’s abilities, further fueling confidence.

   **Examples**

   •    Recognizes one’s skills and achievements and integrate them into your sense of self  
   •    Treats setbacks as a lack of skill, not as personal flaws

---

9. **Temperance**

   Manages stamina as a limited resource, without using it as an excuse for slacking, evasion, or stagnation

   **Example**

   •    Gives 80% of one’s effort to your most valued priorities

---

10. **Self-Reflection**

    Turns lived experiences into lasting insights; avoiding rumination, self-reproach, or decision paralysis.
